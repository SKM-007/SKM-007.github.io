**Background**
----
I am Suryakant Mishra, Director's Research Fellow in Center for Integrated Nanotechnologies at Los Alamos National Laboratroy (LANL), where my work primarily focuses on measuring qunatum properties of diffrent material. My research also focused on Single Photon Emission (SPE) using quantum deffect from qunatum confined material for qunatum communication and computing applications.

A significant portion of my research is also dedicated to dealing with big data generated through these qunatum measurement which are enviorment senstive. By leaveraging the machine learning modeling, I discovers and interpret the complex, hidden correlations within vast datasets. More than 4 years of experience working in DoD and DoE funded user facilities has honed my skills in dealing with various clients and collaborators from both U.S. and international universities and industries. 

**Achievements**
----
  -  Prestigious Director’s Fellowship awarded at LANL worth of 350k$
  -  Professional Membership of “American Chemical Society”
  -  Prestigious Ramanujan Fellowship awarded worth of 200k$
  -  Professional Membership of “American Physical Society”
  -  Qualified GATE with 99.6 percentile out of quarter million participant.
